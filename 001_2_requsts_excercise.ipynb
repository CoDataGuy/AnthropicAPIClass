      "\n",
      "**Key aspects of his life and work:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Literary fame**: Known for his witty plays like *The Importance of Being Earnest* and *Lady Windermere's Fan*, his novel *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, and numerous essays and poems\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Wit and style**: Famous for his sharp epigrams and conversational brilliance. He was a master of paradox and social satire\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Aesthetic movement**: A leading proponent of \"art for art's sake,\" believing art should be valued for its beauty rather than moral or social purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scandal and imprisonment**: In 1895, he was convicted of \"gross indecency\" (homosexual acts) and sentenced to two years' hard labor, which destroyed his health and reputation\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Legacy**: After prison, he lived in exile in France until his death in poverty. Despite his tragic end, he's now celebrated as a literary genius and LGBTQ+ icon\n",
      "\n",
      "Some famous Wilde quotes:\n",
      "- \"I can resist everything except temptation\"\n",
      "- \"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars\"\n",

      "\n",
      "**\"Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "This perfectly captures his wit and philosophy about individualism and authenticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are several other contenders for \"most famous\":\n",
      "\n",
      "- **\"To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **\"I can resist everything except temptation.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **\"The truth is rarely pure and never simple.\"** (from *The Importance of Being Earnest*)\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Be yourself\" quote is probably the most widely shared and recognized today, especially on social media, though interestingly, some scholars debate whether he actually said it in exactly those words. Regardless, it captures his spirit perfectly and has become his most iconic statement.\n",
